# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms repository written in C. This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science. Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science and software development. They provide efficient ways to organize and manipulate data, solve problems, and optimize performance. This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of these concepts in the C programming language.

The repository includes implementations of the following data structures and algorithms:

1. **Data Structures:**
    - Array
    - Linked List
    - Stack
    - Queue
    - Binary Tree
    - Binary Search Tree
    - Heap
    - Hash Table
    - Graph

2. **Algorithms:**
    - Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
    - Searching Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search)
    - Graph Algorithms (Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm)
